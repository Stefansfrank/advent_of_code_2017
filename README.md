Kotlin solutions for Advent of Code 2017

Please be patient with me as I have never written a single line of Kotlin before and my active Java knowledge is more than 10 years old. 
Since I am most fluid in Go, I might occasionally overlook the more elegant implicit construct Kotlin offers and go for the more 
expicit construct. However that might help readability.

For the majority of the puzzles, I found quite satisfying solutions. I might occasionally have too much other things on my plate so that I decide to go some simple non-optimized path but I will then remark in the comments what I would optimize if I had the time. All of the solution finish in under a minute, most in les than 2 seconds.

The solutions are self contained with their own ```main()``` so you should be able to run them without much trouble and the need for additional files.
