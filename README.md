Kotlin solutions for Advent of Code 2017

Please be patient with me as I have never written a single line of Kotlin before and my active Java knowledge is more than 10 years old. 
Since I am most fluid in Go, I might occasionally overlook the more elegant implicit construct Kotlin offers and go for the more 
expicit construct. However that might help readability.

For the majority of the puzzles, I found quite satisfying solutions. I might occasionally have too much other things on my plate so 
that I decide to occasionally go some simple non-optimized path but I will then remark in the comments what I would optimize if I had the time

All of the solutions compute the solutions for all days.
